# grunt-wp-svn

> Grunt plug-in to deploy a project directory to WordPress SVN repo.

### Requirements
* This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.5`
* [Git](http://git-scm.com/) and [SVN](https://subversion.apache.org/) installed and in your PATH.

## Getting Started
If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-wp-svn --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks( 'grunt-wp-svn' );
```

## The "wpsvn" task
_Run this task with the `grunt wpsvn` command._

Task targets, files and options may be specified according to the grunt [Configuring tasks](http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks) guide.
